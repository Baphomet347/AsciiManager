Emojis are for idiots.
Why can't you express yourself properly using words? I hope you do know that prior to the existence of emojis we used regular written vernacular, derived from the evolution of multiple languages over several millennia, to express ourselves.
Many thousands of years ago, inferior cultures used similar to emojis in order to express their thoughts (Egyptian hieroglyphics being a prime example that is well-known amongst intelligent scholars such as myself). By using similar forms of communication, you’re proving yourself inferior both intellectually and culturally.
Do you want to propagate the diminishing value of our culture?
Well, I certainly don’t want to be a part of that, and unfortunately, your behavior is only promoting the devaluation of the culture with which I am forced to identify due to my birthright.
So I ask you: please stop using emojis so that we may all become better as a group of people.
Thank you.
